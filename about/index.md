## A brief introduction ...

Currently, there is a huge interest of companies to integrate things related on the new tech revolution, this will be an investment for a quick grow of them, then, my approach as a Physical engineer combines, mechanical design, electronic design, data science, and technology integration, allowing to interact with different disciplines, also working on a team and adapting for different environments. due to these skills, I have been working in Colombian companies focused on, precision agriculture, textile, and manufacture.

I’m fueled with my passion since when I was a child, I always wanted to be an inventor, and build things with my hands, in fact, if David child asks me what am I doing now, I severely will answer that I’m making our dreams true, in addition, I consider study as a huge tool for my life, not only in professional fields, this could improve every aspect of life, and as an engineer, I’m always looking for solutions, keep learning is my motivation for world serving, in brief, I love the capacity to create ideas and making them true with my tech background. 

I believe that success is the sum of your dedication, motivation, and movement, this leads to a strong feeling of leadership taking the goals and doing them with amazement, excellence, and quality. In my experience as an engineer I could find an amazing achievement done, it was was the improvement of hand made industry process in agriculture, I used artificial intelligence with computer vision to increase performance in the current company process, and also, the employers increased their health quality because all the time, they were exposed to repetitive and humdrum tasks.

I consider that the professional life is strongly related with others aspects as, emotional, spiritual, social, health, and relationships, consequently, I assert that all the time I’m an engineer, musician, friend, son, brother, and voyager, success comes with being integral, in addition, the key of the life is the ability to listen to you, equilibrating heart and mind, I’m in that way, every day meditating, doing Reiki and feeling.

As a perspective of the future, I would like to continue my master degree in robotics, or computer science, as well as, looking for a job in a tech company, where I could continue my growth learning new and amazing things, I’m on the way. Reach out to dfalvearg@gmail.com to connect!.
